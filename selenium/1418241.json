Seriously, the lumberjack/sexuality equation was locked down forty years ago in the Lumberjack Song, beginning \"I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK / I sleep all night and work all day\" and ending with \"I want to be a girlie, just like my dear mama!\"",

   "topComment": "McCain sums it up perfectly. Not only is torture wrong, it doesn't work. Suggested reading: \"How to Break a Terrorist: The U.S. Interrogators Who Used Brains, Not Brutality, to Take Down the Deadliest Man in Iraq,\" by Matthew Alexander. The CIA was awful at getting information from detainees in Iraq. Not only was it terrible at its job, it knew it was terrible at its job and nevertheless worked to prevent military interrogators from trying more clever (and humane) methods. The book is now required reading in some intelligence circles.",
