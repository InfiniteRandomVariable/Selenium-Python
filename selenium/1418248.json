Suggested reading: \"How to Break a Terrorist: The U.S. Interrogators Who Used Brains, Not Brutality, to Take Down the Deadliest Man in Iraq,\" by Matthew Alexander. The CIA was awful at getting information from detainees in Iraq. Not only was it terrible at its job, it knew it was terrible at its job and nevertheless worked to prevent military interrogators from trying more clever (and humane) methods. The book is now required reading in some intelligence circles.",
